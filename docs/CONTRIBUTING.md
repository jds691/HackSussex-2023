# Contributing

## Features

To suggest features or design elements open a discussion in the repo or talk it over with other teammates.

Once the feature has been discussed. Open a Feature Request issue and fill it out.

Implementation details will be discussed and if agreed upon, the feature or design will be triaged and later
implemented.

### Guidelines for Feature Requests

- **Add the feature request to the linked project board**
- Keep requests short and sweet to make them quicker to discuss
- Keep in mind that the jam only lasts 24 hours, make sure your idea is small enough
- If you know the relevant people to discuss implementation with e.g. programmer, artist. Assign them to the issue

# Source Code

To contribute to the source code you will need to following tools:

- [Unity 2023.2.0](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive)
- [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/)
- A Unity supported C# editor ([JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)
  or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/))

## Making Changes

To begin making changes, look at the project board for tasks you think you could complete or are already assigned to
you.

Once you have selected a task, indicate that you will be completing the task and assign the task to yourself.

To begin making changes to the repo, create a branch based off of the main branch.

Name it descriptively so at a glance people know what feature it is.

## Merging Changes

Once you have finished implementing your feature open a pull request. From whatever your working branch is, to the main
branch of this repo.

Your pull request should mention the change in it's title as well as the task/issue identifier e.g. [Feature] New
Feature (#123456)

This should also be mentioned in the description.

The pull request will be checked for any issues flagged by GitHub and then later merged.
