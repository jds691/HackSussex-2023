# Contributing

## Features

To suggest features or design elements open a discussion in the repo or talk it over with other teammates.

Once the feature has been discussed. Open a Feature Request issue and fill it out.

Implementation details will be discussed and if agreed upon, the feature or design will be triaged and later
implemented.

### Guidelines for Feature Requests

- **Add the feature request to the linked project board**
- Keep requests short and sweet to make them quicker to discuss
- Keep in mind that the jam only lasts 24 hours, make sure your idea is small enough
- If you know the relevant people to discuss implementation with e.g. programmer, artist. Assign them to the issue
